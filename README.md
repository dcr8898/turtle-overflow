##Turtle Overflow

Turtle Overflow is a tribute to the popular Stack Overflow site.  It was built as a learning exercise to explore Rails, ActiveRecord, and Agile development, by:
* [Steven Leiva](https://github.com/stevenxl),
* [Peter Rosal](https://github.com/r05al), and
* [Damian Rossney](https://github.com/dcr8898).

Technologies used:

* Ruby 2.2.3

* Rails 4.2.1

* JQuery 2.1.3

* Postgres 9.3

* Skeleton CSS

* Rspec

* Capybara

##Our Process
The user stories that guided our process were as follows:

* As a developer, I would like to be able to ask development-related questions and received comprehensive answers from experts in the field in order to improve my knowledge.

* As the asker of a question, I would like to be able to select the answer I believe best solves the question or problem I proposed in order to recognize good information and the authors thereof.

* As an expert, I would like to assist fellow developers by responding to their requests for information or assistance with answers based on experience and industry standards and best practices in order to improve the overall quality of the developer community.

* As a developer, I would like to review previous questions and answers so that I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I run into a problem.

##Development
We utilized a streamlined agile process based on the Kanban system (see Our Process above).  To ensure proper git hygiene, we utilized the [Steven G. Harms Enhanced Rebase Optimized Team Enabled Git Workflow(tm)](https://github.com/nyc-mud-turtles-2015/phase-2-guide/blob/nyc/resources/git_workflow.md).
